Public terrain tiles for interactive web map visualizations

Coming soon...

## Roadmap
### Global Copernicus
Create a global low-resolution terrain tileset based on ESA's Copernicus 30 m digital elevation model.

### Regional Lidar
Create regional high-resolution terrain tilesets based on national Lidar digital elevation models. The resolution can be as high as 50 cm.

### Aggregation
Aggregate and merge high-resolution Lidar terrain tilesets where possible.
